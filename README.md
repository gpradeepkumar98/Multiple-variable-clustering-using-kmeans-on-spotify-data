# Multiple-variable-clustering-using-kmeans-on-spotify-data

About

This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering to group songs from the Spotify dataset based on their audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, and more. It provides a clear example of how to perform multiple-variable clustering using Python and Google colab.
