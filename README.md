"Music Clustering with K-Means: Unveiling Audio Patterns in Spotify Data"


This repository contains a Python script and Jupyter Notebook demonstrating multiple variable clustering using the K-Means clustering algorithm on Spotify dataset. The purpose of this project is to explore the application of K-Means clustering to group songs based on multiple audio features and discover interesting patterns within music data.

Introduction

Music is a highly complex and multidimensional form of art. Spotify provides audio features for millions of songs, including danceability, energy, instrumentalness, tempo, and more. K-Means clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning technique that can be applied to group songs with similar audio characteristics together. This project utilizes K-Means clustering to discover clusters of songs with similar audio profiles, potentially uncovering hidden patterns in music data.
Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:

    NumPy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    Spotipy (for accessing Spotify's API)
    Matplotlib
    Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn spotipy matplotlib jupyter

Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/gpradeepkumar98/Multiple-variable-clustering-using-kmeans-on-spotify-data

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

    cd Multiple-variable-clustering-using-kmeans-on-spotify-data

    Open the Jupyter Notebook (spotify_kmeans.ipynb) in your preferred environment or editor.

Usage

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to perform multiple variable clustering using K-Means on the Spotify dataset. The notebook includes code snippets and explanations to guide you through each part of the process. You can run the code cells interactively in the notebook.

To run the provided Python script instead of the notebook, you can execute the following command in your terminal:

bash

python kmeans_spotify.py

This will generate clusters of songs based on their audio features and provide insights into the characteristics of each cluster.
Results

After running the code in the notebook or the Python script, you will obtain results that include:

    Clusters of songs grouped together based on their audio features.
    Visualizations to illustrate the distribution of songs within each cluster.

These results can offer valuable insights into the diversity of music styles, preferences, and characteristics within the Spotify dataset. They can also serve as a starting point for further analysis, such as recommending similar songs to users or understanding the trends in music genres.
